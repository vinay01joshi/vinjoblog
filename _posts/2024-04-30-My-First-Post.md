# A Magical Keyboard Project: Building Your Own Programmable Keyboard

## Introduction
Welcome back to vinjo.Skills, the place where we explore the latest and coolest tech in the world of electronics and technology. In today's blog, we will be discussing a fascinating project called "A Magical Keyboard." This project allows you to build your very own programmable keyboard, which can be customized using the Arduino programming language and C++ libraries. We will guide you through the process of building this keyboard using a Pro Micro microcontroller, 3D printing technology, and the Arduino IDE. Let's dive in and explore the magical world of this project!

## Building the Keyboard
The first part of the project involves building the keyboard itself. To accomplish this, we will be using a Pro Micro microcontroller, keyboard keys, a 3D printer (specifically an FDM printer), and the Arduino IDE. You can find a list of all the required parts on our website.
The keyboard is made up of two main components: the keyboard keys and the controller box. The controller box serves as the housing for the keyboard and provides additional functionalities such as a charging socket. We have designed the controller box using a 3D printer, and the STL files for the box can be found on our website.
Please note that the current design of the box is not optimized. It was created simply to fit all the necessary components within the project. We plan to optimize and improve the design in the future. The printing process for both the controller box and the key shells may take up to 6 hours, but we are constantly working on finding ways to shorten this time.
## Wiring and Programming the Keyboard
Once the keyboard and the controller box are printed, it's time to wire everything together and program the keyboard. The first step is to connect the keyboard keys to the Pro Micro microcontroller using wires. We provide a detailed diagram on our website that illustrates how to properly connect the wires to the pins of the microcontroller.
After the wiring is complete, you can connect the Pro Micro microcontroller to your laptop using a USB cable. This connection allows you to program the microcontroller and define the functionality of each key. We have included the necessary code within the video, and a repository with the code is available for you to explore.
Before you start programming, make sure to add the keyboard library to your Arduino IDE. This library is essential for the keys to function properly. Once that is done, you can upload the code to the microcontroller and test the functionality of the keys. Each key should correspond to a specific action, such as typing a letter or triggering a function.

## Final Product Demonstration
After successfully wiring and programming the keyboard, it's time to see the final result. The fully assembled keyboard, along with the controller box, is both functional and visually appealing. We have put in a lot of effort to ensure that the keys and the box fit together seamlessly.
We appreciate your support and encourage you to follow and subscribe to our channel for more exciting projects like this one. Stay tuned for future updates, as we continue to optimize the design and functionality of the magical keyboard. Thank you for joining us!
